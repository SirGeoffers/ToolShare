# ToolShare
ToolShare webapp created for Intro to SE

This webapp was created to model a scenario where communities could set up public tool sheds for members of the community
to share and use tools.  The webapp supports profile creation/management, toolshed creation/management, and the ability to rent
or share tools within your community shed.

The webapp was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Django, and Twitter Bootstrap.

This webapp was created over the course of 4 months with a team of 5.
The team consisted of:
  1 team lead
  1 requirements coordinator
  2 main developers
  1 QA

Installation instructions included in the ToolShare directory (readme.txt)
